# PyCitySchools - School Performance Analysis

## Overview 
### This project utilized pandas and python to effectively analyze school and standardized test data. These tools guide us in uncovering trends and making educated conclusions, that can further improve our understanding of the district's performance and its needs. 

## Key Functions Used 
* groupby(), mean(), count(), sum() for aggregations
* pd.DataFrame() for structured data representation
* pd.cut() for binning data into categories

## Report 
### This analysis highlights extremely significant findings in terms of disparities in school performance. Two important conclusions to be made is that firstly, charter schools consistently outperform district schools across every metric or standard established. The second important conclusion would be that district schools have extremely low math passing rates, with a 66.55%. To draw a conclusion between school types, reading is also lower in district schools, however the difference is not significant. To alleviate the burden of these findings, decision makers must appropriately respond to this data with effective intervention strategies. Examples could include math focused support, and try to emulate the strategies of charter schools. Another recommendation, that is supported by the findings is the lack of funding in district schools, when compared to charter, therefore increased funding and resources could also increase the performance of students.
